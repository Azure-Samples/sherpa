# Camp 4: Monitoring & Observability

*"Reaching Observation Peak"*

!!! info "Camp Details"
    **Duration:** 90 minutes  
    **Azure Services:** Log Analytics, Application Insights, Azure Monitor  
    **Primary Risks:** [MCP08](https://microsoft.github.io/mcp-azure-security-guide/mcp/mcp08-telemetry/) (Lack of Audit and Telemetry)

## What You'll Learn

At the final camp before the summit, you'll learn to see everything happening across your MCP infrastructure. Comprehensive monitoring and observability are essential for detecting attacks, troubleshooting issues, and maintaining compliance.

!!! tip "Learning Objectives"
    - Implement comprehensive logging for MCP operations
    - Set up Log Analytics workspaces and queries
    - Build monitoring dashboards for real-time visibility
    - Configure intelligent alert rules
    - Detect security threats through log analysis

## The Challenge

Without proper monitoring, attacks go unnoticed and issues remain hidden until they become crises. You'll experience the blindness of a system without telemetry, then build a comprehensive observability solution.

## What You'll Build
