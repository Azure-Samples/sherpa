# Camp 2: Gateway Security

*"Scaling the Gateway Ridge"*

!!! info "Camp Details"
    **Duration:** 90 minutes  
    **Azure Services:** API Management, Private Endpoints, API Center  
    **Primary Risks:** MCP09 (Shadow MCP Servers), MCP02 (Privilege Escalation)

## What You'll Learn

At this elevation, you'll establish a secure gateway layer for your MCP infrastructure. Learn how to centralize access control, enforce policies, and gain visibility into all MCP server traffic across your organization.

!!! tip "Learning Objectives"
    - Deploy Azure API Management as an MCP gateway
    - Implement network isolation with Private Endpoints
    - Establish governance with API Center
    - Configure rate limiting and throttling
    - Detect and prevent shadow MCP servers

## The Challenge

Without a central gateway, MCP servers proliferate across your organization—each with different security standards, creating blind spots for attackers. You'll build a unified gateway that brings order to chaos.

## What You'll Build

    ---

    Use Private Endpoints to keep MCP servers off the public internet

- :material-library:{ .lg .middle } __API Center Governance__

    ---

    Catalog and govern all MCP servers in your organization
