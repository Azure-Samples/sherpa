# The Summit: Secure MCP in Production

*Reaching the Peak*

![Summit](../images/sherpa-summit.png)

!!! info "Summit Details"
    **Tech Stack:** All previous camps combined - Entra ID, APIM, Azure Functions, Container Apps, Log Analytics, Application Insights  
    **Primary Focus:** End-to-end secure MCP deployment with red team/blue team exercises

## Welcome to the Summit!

Congratulations on completing all four skill-building camps! You've learned:

| Camp | What You Secured |
|------|------------------|
| **Base Camp** | Understanding MCP vulnerabilities |
| **Camp 1: Identity** | OAuth 2.0 + Entra ID authentication |
| **Camp 2: Gateway** | APIM protection + rate limiting |
| **Camp 3: I/O Security** | Input validation + output sanitization |
| **Camp 4: Monitoring** | Full observability + alerting |

Now it's time to put it all together. The Summit is where you deploy a **complete, production-ready secure MCP infrastructure** and validate it with realistic attack scenarios.

## Coming Soon

!!! warning "Under Construction"
    The Summit workshop is currently in development. Check back soon!

### What to Expect

The Summit will include:

- **Full Stack Deployment** - Deploy all security layers in a single, integrated architecture
- **Red Team Exercises** - Attack your own infrastructure with realistic threat scenarios
- **Blue Team Response** - Use your monitoring and alerting to detect and respond
- **Production Hardening** - Final security checklist and best practices
- **Graduation Certificate** - Complete the challenge and prove your MCP security skills

### In the Meantime

While we finish building the Summit, make sure you've completed all the prerequisite camps:

- [Base Camp](base-camp.md) - Understand MCP vulnerabilities
- [Camp 1: Identity](camp1-identity.md) - Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication
- [Camp 2: Gateway](camp2-gateway.md) - Deploy APIM protection
- [Camp 3: I/O Security](camp3-io-security.md) - Add input/output validation
- [Camp 4: Monitoring](camp4-monitoring.md) - Enable observability and alerting

Each camp builds on the previous one, so completing them in order will prepare you for the Summit challenge.
