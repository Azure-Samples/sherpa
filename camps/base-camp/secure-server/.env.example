# Base Camp Secure Server - Authentication Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and customize as needed

# Authentication token for the workshop
# This token grants access to user_001 (Alice Johnson)
AUTH_TOKEN=workshop_demo_token_12345

# NOTE: In a real implementation, you would:
# 1. Use different tokens for different users (token-to-user mapping)
# 2. Store tokens securely in Azure Key Vault
# 3. Use OAuth 2.1 tokens with expiration
# 4. Implement token refresh mechanisms
#
# This simple approach is for workshop demonstration only!
# See Camp 1 for production-grade authentication.
