# Camp 4: Monitoring & Observability
# =================================
# This workshop demonstrates the "hidden → visible → actionable" pattern.
#
# Initial deployment uses security-function-v1 which has BASIC logging -
# security events are logged but invisible to monitoring and alerting.
#
# Workshop participants will:
# 1. See how attacks are "hidden" (no APIM diagnostic logs, basic function logs)
# 2. Enable APIM diagnostics and upgrade to v2 structured logging (visible)
# 3. Create dashboards and alerts (actionable)

  # Security Function v1: Basic Logging (the "hidden" state)
  # --------------------------------------------------------
  # Uses logging.warning() - works but can't be queried, correlated, or alerted on.
  # Workshop starts with APIM pointing to v1, then switches to v2 in Section 2.2.

    project: ./security-function-v1

  # Security Function v2: Structured Logging (the "visible" state)
  # --------------------------------------------------------------
  # Uses security_logger.py with Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry.
  # Enables KQL queries, correlation IDs, and alerting.
  # Both functions are deployed; workshop switches via APIM named value update.
